									<h2>Dataset</h2>
									<p> Here we have provided a sample combination data of landsat 8 and SMAP after preprocessing and band value calculation.

									<p>Salinity is an important factor in determining many aspects of the chemistry of natural
										waters and of biological processes within it, and is a thermodynamic state variable that,
										along with temperature and pressure, governs physical characteristics like the density and
										heat capacity of the water. </p>
									<p>High concentrations of salt pose hazards for the environment.
									<li>Affecting agriculture, drinking water supplies .</li>
									High levels of salinity may cause:
									<li> Corrosion of machinery and infrastructure such as fences, roads and bridges </li>
									<li>Poor health or death of native vegetation, leading to a decline in biodiversity through dominance of salt-resistant species, potentially altering ecosystem structures </li>
									<li>Reduction in crop yields by impairing the growth and health of salt intolerant crops.</li>
									</p>

									<h2>Dataset Informations</h2>
									<p>There are several satellite data present to learn about various parameters and characteristics of water bodies
									present. Few datasets are as follows
									<li>Landsat 8 : Landsat 8 is an American Earth observation satellite launched on 11 February 2013. It is the eighth satellite in the Landsat program; the seventh to reach orbit successfully. Originally called the Landsat Data Continuity Mission (LDCM),
										it is a collaboration between NASA and the United States Geological Survey (USGS).It comprises the camera of the Operational Land Imager (OLI) and the Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) which can be used to study Earth surface temperature and is used
										to study global warming.Providing moderate-resolution imagery, from 15 metres to 100 metres, of Earth's land surface and polar regions, Landsat 8 operates in the visible, near-infrared, short wave infrared, and thermal infrared spectrums.
										Landsat 8 captures more than 700 scenes a day.Landsat data downloading can be done from <a href="https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/">https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov.</a> </li>
									<li>Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity : Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) is a satellite which forms part of ESA's Living Planet Programme. It is intended to provide new insights into Earth's water cycle and climate. In addition,
										it is intended to provide improved weather forecasting and monitoring of snow and ice accumulation. The goal of the SMOS mission is to monitor surface soil moisture with an accuracy of 4%
										(at 35â€“50 km spatial resolution). SMOS has been used to improve hurricane forecasting by collecting hurricane surface-level wind speed data using its novel microwave imaging radiometer, which can penetrate the
										thick clouds surrounding a cyclone. SMOS data downloading can be done from <a href="https://earth.esa.int/eogateway/missions/smos/data">https://earth.esa.int/eogateway/missions/smos/data.</a></li>
									<li>Soil Moisture Active Passive :  </li>
									<li>Aquarius</li>

									<h2>Machine Learning frameworks and models</h2>
									<p> We have used the Scikit-learn framework which has different packages. We have used certain packages like
									<li>Train_test_split - This module is used to split the dataset into training and testing datasets</li>
									<li>LinearRegression - This module is used to study the relationship between a dependent variable (Y) with a given set of independent variables (X). </li>
									<li>Metrics - This module implements mean square error, mean absolute error,   root mean squared error and Coefficient of determination</li>
									<li>StandardScaler- This module helps to standardize a feature by subtracting the mean and then scaling to unit variance</li>
									<li>PCA - This module simplifies the complexity in high-dimensional data while retaining trends and patterns. </li>
									<li>RandomForestRegressor - This module is used as a meta estimator that fits a number of decision tree classifiers on various sub-samples of the
										dataset and uses averaging to improve the predictive accuracy and control over-fitting.</li> </p>
									 <p> We have used the following Machine Learning models to predict salinity:
										<li>Multiple linear regression (MLR) </li>
										<li>Random Forest (RF) </li>
										<li>Random Forest with Principal component analysis (RF with PCA).</li>
